Managing Principals
###################

A Principal is an authenticated user that is a member of the Account. Principals can be searched and added to Groups in order to grant access to resources. RBAC itself does not perform any enforcement of that access, instead enforcement is left to the application logic. API endpoints involving Principals may only be accessed by Account Administrators.
